# Bombe
Bombe is a crypto challenge scoring server

We are in the initial phase defining the features our scoring server will have, currently they are...

- Run multiple crypto challenges at one time.
- Crypto challenges can auto start and stop.
- Puzzles will have point values.
- One or more hints can be scheduled for a puzzle.  
- When hints are revealed, the point value for the puzzle will decrease a configurable amount.
- Multiple Bombe servers can be ran at one time.
- Server will have the option to publish puzzles to a remote bombe server.
- Bombe will tweet hints.
- Most points wins, with tie going to the fastest.
- Puzzles can stand-alone or chained together (solving a puzzle opens up a new puzzle).
- Log all guesses so admin can review if a puzzle was a problem by having several people getting the same wrong answer.
